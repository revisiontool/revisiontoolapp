This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.


Project is made using NextJs along with TailwindCSS. It can be run just like a standard NextJs app. It is currently deployed on Vercel at http://revision-tool-new.vercel.app/ Any further changes shall require a separate deployment.

Components and pages have separate directories and files to make the codebase easier to understand.

Data is stored statically and doesnâ€™t use any database. Data for Math and Economics is stored in MathData.js and EconomicsData.js. Below is an example of a single question data format stored. However, please refer to other questions to fully understand the structure of a single question. If you want to change the questions, then make changes to corresponding question in those files.

new QuestionModel({id: "1.1", // Unique ID for the question. Format shall remain same.
bigQuestionNo: 1, // Question No for main Question
smallQuestionNo: 1, // Question No for the sub questions in the main question
question: "Define an arithmetic series?", // Sub Question
type: "text", // It supports 'image' if image is used for display
options: [
new OptionsModel({
value: "A", // Option
optionText: // Value attached to the option
"A series with a common difference between any two terms",
}),
new OptionsModel({
value: "B",
optionText:
"A series with a common difference between two consecutive terms",
}),
new OptionsModel({
value: "C",
optionText:
"A series with a common difference between the first and second term",
}),
new OptionsModel({
value: "D",
optionText:
"A series with a common ratio between two consecutive terms"
})
],
correct: "B", // Correct answer
planningScreen: new PlanningScreenModel({
heading: 'Arithmetic Series',
question: 'Define an arithmetic series?',
answer: "A series with a common difference between two consecutive terms",
typeScreen: "text"
}), // Data to be displayed on the planning Screen
answerScreen: null, // Data to be displayed on the answer screen
boxQuestion: 'Define an arithmetic series?', // Question that shows up on Box for sub question
boxDisplay: "Guiding Question Prompt 1.1", // head tag for the sub question
headQuestion: 'In an arithmetic sequence, the first term is 10 and second term is 6.', // main question
headDisplay: "Official Question", // head tag for main question
tags: ["Crafting the Perfect Response"], // other tags on this question, can be multiple
learningObjectives: [], // Learning Objectives related to this question
mark: 6, // Total marks for the whole question
sub_marks: 0, // marks for this particular sub question
difficulty: 2, // Difficulty level
date: "2019-05-01", // Release date of question
estimatedTime: 2, // Estimate time to do the question
}),



App uses a caching mechanism with Redux-Persist to maintain and recover Redux state. Therefore, progress saved for users is not universal and is device-dependent.

App uses Auth0 for authentication and it is in testing mode and can allow up to 7000 authenticated users.

All 3rd party apps use revisiontooldev@gmail.com 

Further understanding of code can only be acquired by reading through the code.
